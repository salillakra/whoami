## Development

### Adding UI Components

To add shadcn/ui components, run:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component-name> -c apps/web
```

Components will be added to `packages/ui/src/components`.

### File Structure Best Practices

- Place page-specific components in `apps/web/components`
- Use `packages/ui` for shared, reusable components
- Keep animations in `components/animations`
- Store static assets in `apps/web/assets`

## Building for Production

```bash
# Build all packages and applications
pnpm build

# Build only the web application
pnpm build --filter=web
```
